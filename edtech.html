         <p> Screencasting, become your own Kahn. Doceri is my newest obsession. Check out my recent review for Benchmark 3. You can draw on your tablet as you are presenting in class. Hit record and upload it to YouTube. Students can rewatch your INM or you can use it to flip your classroom..</p>

         <p> The second layer of learning to screencasting: checks for understanding and assessment. This way students are not only watching your lesson, but engaging with it as well. You gain a "live" view of student progress so you can loop in with students who aren't mastering the content. Here's an example (my first one) that I tried last month. 
<br><br>
Also a great way to show students a short YouTube clip and record your own audio to engage them in a way that's aligned to your lesson. For example, I recorded my guided practice questions over clips of heat transfer demos. </p>

         <p> Originally a screencasting, student response tool for iPads and now offers a web browser so students with computers can get on. Nearpod shares your presentation (must be made or imported within NearPod) directly onto student devices. When students are asked to respond, they can submit multiple choice or free response answers. The coolest part is the "Draw It" feature, where students' devices become virtual whiteboards. Teachers can see what each student is drawing/solving in real time. Teachers can then select an answer (the student becomes anonymous) to share with the class. Really cool  way to blend screencasting and formative assessment. The ability to "see" every student response is probably the most advantageous  (and coolest!) feature.
